Longitude/Latitude Tests
========================

This is currently an example of how to plot longitude and latitude values
on a JFrame. If you run Test2.scala, the result is a JFrame with a bunch
of yellow dots that looks like the United States.

In the long term this project might grow into something else, but that's
what it is today.
